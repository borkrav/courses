1. 

copyin copies a block of specified length from user level adress to kernel adress

copyout copies a block of specified length from kernel adress to user level adress

2.

UIO_USERISPACE is executable segment in the user address space, UIOUSERSPACE is a non-executable segment in the user address space, and UIO_SYSSPACE is a segment in the kernel address space 

3.

vfs_close() closes the ELF file that contains the executable for the program being run. This is done so source code can't be changed from user mode

4.

md_usermode

5. pointer to a segment in the user adress space

6. Because the current implementation does kernel panic, which means that calling kill_curthread would crash the whole kernel

7. When mips_syscall is invoked, interrupts are enabled. When kill_curthread is called interrups are probably on

8. vfs_open

9. close, open, reclaim, read, readlink, getdirentry, write, ioctl, stat, gettype, tryseek, dsynch, mmap, truncate, namefile, create, symlink, mkdir, link, remove, rmdir, rename, lookup, lookupparent, check, incref, decref, incopen, decopen, init, kill. 

When two processes open the same file, the same vnode may be used
