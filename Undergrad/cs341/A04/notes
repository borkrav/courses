How the test is generated:

For a test size n, a vector A is filled with values from 1-2n. A vector B of pairs is generated from these values, with the every pair containing the biggest and smallest value from vector A. These two values are then deleted from A. Then, s is set to (0,0) and t is set to (n*2, n*2). The vector B is shuffled using random_shuffle and printed to standard output


Results:

n	time
1000	1.00
2000	4.26
4000	17.90
8000	74.42

If n doubles, time quadruples, therefore the algorithm is n^2, which agrees with the theoretical analysis
