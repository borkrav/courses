How input is generated:

For a test size n, a vector of size 3n is generated and filled with values from 0 to 3n-1. From this vector, 3 values are picked and deleted from 3 random indexes. 1/2 of the time, these 3 values become a vertical line, 1/2 of the time these 3 values become a horizontal line. This is repeated n times to generate n lines. So, generated output has n/2 vertical and n/2 horizontal lines.

Results(in seconds)

Input Size(n)	Divide And Conquer	Brute Force
5000		0.17			0.35
10000		0.37			1.38
50000		2.28			34.46
100000		4.85			137.22
200000		10.40			550.01

These experimental results agree with my theoretical analysis, as the divide and conquer algorithm runs much faster then the brute force solution for very large n
